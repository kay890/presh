                If you're visiting this page, you're likely here because you're
                searching for a random sentence. Sometimes a random word just
                isn't enough, and that is where the random sentence generator
                comes into play. By inputting the desired number, you can make a
                list of as many random sentences as you want or need. Producing
                random sentences can be helpful in a number of different ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                For writers, a random sentence can help them get their creative
                juices flowing. Since the topic of the sentence is completely
                unknown, it forces the writer to be creative when the sentence
                appears. There are a number of different ways a writer can use
                the random sentence for creativity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most common way to use the sentence is to begin a story.
                Another option is to include it somewhere in the story. A much
                more difficult challenge is to use it to end a story. In any of
                these cases, it forces the writer to think creatively since they
                have no idea what sentence will appear from the tool.
              </p>
              <p>
                For those writers who have writers' block, this can be an
                excellent way to take a step to crumbling those walls.
